# KSS (Keyword Search Script)

This script searches recursively through all of the files (starting from within the current directory) for a given keyword. Each file containing the keyword will be copied to a new directory 'kss_results' that will be automatically created. The file will be appended with line numbers in which the keyword occurs. Hence, if 'kss_results' directory is empty after running the script, no desired files were found.
